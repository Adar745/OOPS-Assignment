        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around organizing and structuring code in terms of objects and their interactions. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "#1.Encapsulation\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object.\n",
        "   - It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, ensuring controlled interaction through methods.\n",
        "   - Example: Using private or protected variables in a class and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access or modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2.Abstraction\n",
        "   - Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionality.\n",
        "   - It allows a programmer to work at a higher level of thinking without worrying about internal complexities.\n",
        "   - Example: A \"Vehicle\" class might expose a `drive()` method without detailing how the engine works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3.Inheritance\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows a new class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "   - This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "   - Example: A `Car` class might inherit from a `Vehicle` class and add specific attributes like `number_of_wheels`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4.Polymorphism\n",
        "   - Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes).\n",
        "   - It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, particularly when overriding or overloading methods.\n",
        "   - Example: A `draw()` method could be implemented differently in `Circle` and `Square` classes but be called uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5.Composition\n",
        "   - Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Rather than inheriting, objects are made up of other objects, fostering modularity and flexibility.\n",
        "   - Example: A `Car` class could have a `Engine` object as a component rather than inheriting from an `Engine` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "These principles make OOP a powerful paradigm for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable software."

        "The Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "The Diamond Problem occurs in object-oriented programming (OOP) when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This creates a diamond-shaped inheritance structure. The problem arises when the child class inherits the same method or attribute from two different parent classes, which in turn both inherit from a common grandparent class. This can lead to ambiguity about which method to use if both parent classes define the same method or attribute.\n",

        "Potential Issue:\n",
        "If both B and C have a method with the same name, and class D calls that method, Python needs to decide whether to call B's or C's method. If both methods are different or have side effects, this could lead to inconsistency or errors.\n",
